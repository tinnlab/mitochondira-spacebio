This folder contains a pearson correlation of all biochemical parameters comapered against the amount of radiation absorbed and the days spent at the ISS. 
The "correlation_vs_radiation_absorbed" folder computes the Pearson correlation for either mitochondria processes or metabolic processes or immune/cell fate processes compared against the amount of radiation absorbed. Analysis was done at ⍺=0.05, applying Bonferoni's corrections to remove false positives.
The "correlation_vs_radiation_absorbed" folder computes the Pearson correlation for either mitochondria processes or metabolic processes or immune/cell fate processes compared against the number of days spent at the ISS. Analysis was done at ⍺=0.05, applying Bonferoni's corrections to remove false positives.
The "Correlation line plot folder" contains curve-fits of the most statistically significant correlated pairs with the amount of radiation absorbed. This curves are fitted for both in-flight and post-flight samples to see their variations.
